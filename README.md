# NWU Tech Trends Benefit Realisation Power BI Report

## Overview
This Power BI report visualizes the benefits realized from NWU Tech Trends' projects and clients. The report focuses on key metrics such as time saved per client and project, along with a breakdown of project and client monitoring. The report allows stakeholders to explore the data interactively by filtering and drilling through to specific insights.

- **Total Clients**: Displays the total number of clients.
- **Total Savings per Client**: Bar chart showing total savings for each client.
- **Project Distribution by Client**: Donut chart showing project distribution across clients.

### 2. Project Monitoring
- **Project Table**: Lists all projects with their client, start date, end date, and time saved.
- **Time Saved per Project**: Bar chart showing total time saved for each project.
- **Date Filter**: A slicer to filter projects by start or end date.

### 3. Client Monitoring
